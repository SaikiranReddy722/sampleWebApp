    <h1>Hello Milky Way</h1>
    <p>
        The conventional method of driving relies on visual input to make decisions.
        Our constant reference point for lane orientation on the road is provided by the
        lines marking our lanes. One of the fundamental and initial tasks in the development
        of a self-driving car is the implementation of an algorithm for the automatic
        detection of lane lines.  The primary objective of Lane Detection and Assistance Systems
        is to provide accurate real-time information about the vehicle's position within the lane 
        and to assist the driver or autonomous vehicle in maintaining safe and precise lane-keeping.
